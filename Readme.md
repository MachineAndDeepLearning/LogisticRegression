# Logistic regression

This project implements a variety of simple logistic regression models for the following problem domains
* Donut type datasets
* XOR
* Ecommerce data
* Sentiment analysis from [Here](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/index2.html)
* Facial Representation 
	* Needs the data from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) to be placed in Data/fer2013
	
It also implements some basic functions for logistic regressions
* Cross entropy
* L1 regularization
